Enforce new minimum version â€” [Eleventy v3.0.0-alpha.15](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.15) or later is now **required** for this plugin to function.

Although this goes against the _backwards compatibility_ ethos of Eleventy, the addition of the `getShortcodes()` and `getPairedShortcodes()` functions that were added in `alpha.15` are now utilized in this plugin to bring even more goodness to your templates.

Thanks [@zachleat](https://github.com/zachleat) for making this possible!
